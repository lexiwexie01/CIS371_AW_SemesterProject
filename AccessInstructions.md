To run this app for you, I am going to try running it on an EOS machine remotely. Please let me know if this works or if I need to try something else. I have tried to deploy it to many websites but I couldn't figure it out, either they weren't compatible with Express or the builds kept failing.

To log in, go to localhost:3000/assignment-scheduler-login.
From there, you can log in with any of these accounts:

| First Name | Last Name  | Email           | Password     |
|------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Alexis     | Webster    | alexis@web.com  | $Password1   |
| test       | user       | test@user.com   | @TestUser2   |
| George     | Washington | george@wash.com | GeorgePass@1 |
| Cat        | Dog        | cat@dog.org     | CatDog#4     |

You may also create assignments in guest mode if you click "Guest Planner" from the login page.
